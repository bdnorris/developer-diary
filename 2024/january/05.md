"I came across the same error when I installed version 7.0.0-beta.56. I figured it was a development bug, since it was not more than 2 hours since they had released this new version. So I followed up and saw that the builtin/ folder did not exist, (this folder should be inside the helpers/ folder) and the files that the builtin/ folder should contain were at the same level, that is, in the helpers/ folder, so the easiest solution I found was to create builtin/ folder inside helpers/ folder and move or copy the contents of the helpers/folder inside helpers/builtin/."
- working on it, but I can't even connect to the database
- turns out you can't trust looking up your IP on a company computer, used another computer, got my real IP, added it to the database's whitelist, and now everything works.
- make snapshot of staging just in case, then going to try a staging deploy.
- having issues with mup commands not working
- got through that, but deploy build is getting stuck at 0%
