It could be a site consisting of 100s of pages, or just 6. The goal is to aim for something that might have a lot of content, but you’ll only end up showing smaller pieces of it for this project.</p> <p>It will depend on your concept, but you will likely need to come up with the entire architecture for the site in an outline format, you will then focus on the three (or so) most important pages.</p> <p>So don’t be afraid to think big, the rest of the assignment will only focus on the most important parts.</p> <ul><li>Don’t be afraid to make your site <strong>interactive or have useful tools</strong>. Even if you don't know how to code the interactivity, you can still concept it and show the idea in your designs.</li> <li>Make your site <strong>useful and informative</strong>. It should have text and image content. You will show a small portion, but the implication is there could be a lot deeper in the site.</li> <li>Pick something you’re passionate about, choose a subject that will keep you engaged.</li> <li>But <strong>don’t make it about yourself</strong>. No portfolio sites.</li> <li>It doesn’t have to be a million-dollar idea. Keep in mind, the main objective of this project is <em>the workflow itself</em>.</li> <li>Come up with a few different ideas to discuss with me so we can pick the one that will fulfill the goals of this project the best.</li></ul> <h3 id="define-your-audience-and-write-your-brief"><a href="#define-your-audience-and-write-your-brief" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Define your audience and write your brief</h3> <p>You will need to write a &quot;design brief&quot; for me to approve in order to move forward with your project. It should follow the following format:</p> <ol><li><p>Briefly describe what your website is about or otherwise describe its function.</p></li> <li><p>Company / Organization</p> <ul><li>Describe the organization behind the site. Who is the site owner (real or fictional)?</li></ul></li> <li><p>Purpose</p> <ul><li><p>What are the reasons someone would come to your site (information, entertainment, news, look up products/pricing, make a purchase, get contact details)?</p></li> <li><p>What is would the key metric of success be (sales, contacts, influence)?</p></li></ul></li> <li><p>Audience</p> <ul><li>Write a bit about your target audience.

It can mean a page on a site that lists all the pages, kind of like an index. It can also mean a file with links to all the pages of your site that you can submit to search engines to make sure your site is well indexed.</p> <p>Here, when we say &quot;sitemap&quot; we mean a diagram of your website's hierarchy. Since this diagram represents the pages and their relationships, it can be though of as a &quot;map&quot; of your site.</p> <p>We’re aiming for a <strong>traditional sitemap</strong> on this project, that <strong>must account for all pages on our site</strong> (large amounts of repetitive pages would be abstracted into a “stack” or some other visual metaphor). Additionally, incorporating some “flow” concepts might be useful, especially if the user flow is particularly complex.</p> <h3 id="navigation"><a href="#navigation" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Navigation</h3> <p>Working out the Information Architecture and creating a sitemap helps you define your main navigation items. A large site likely doesn't have a link to every page in it's navigation. The IA work here makes it clear what should be in the navigation and how the nav should be structured. Orphaned pages that don't live in the hierarchy are good candidates for &quot;Utility Navigation&quot;.</p> <h3 id="guidelines"><a href="#guidelines" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Guidelines</h3> <p>You can develop your “sitemap” in the style and program of your choosing.

It depends a lot on the level of detail you want to establish. Simple thumbnail wireframes can be used to plan the IA and content areas as I’ve mentioned above, and further detail can be achieved with static wireframes consisting of gray boxes and text in Illustrator, Photoshop, XD, or Sketch.</p> <h3 id="parts-of-a-wireframe"><a href="#parts-of-a-wireframe" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Parts of a wireframe</h3> <p>With wireframe, we are now at the page level of our hierarchy. Your wireframes should show the content hierarchy of the items that go on that page. However, they don't need to have specific content and can show content somewhat generically.</p> <p>Generally, aim for headings and actions to have the real copy, but body copy can just be lorem ipsum. Photos are almost never necessary unless you want to pick a few generic ones to represent &quot;photo&quot; in a generic/abstract way.</p> <h3 id="prototyping"><a href="#prototyping" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Prototyping</h3> <p>For the sake of time, I am not requiring prototyping on this assignment. However, if you are using Sketch or XD, it may very well be trivial to add some basic prototyping to your wireframes that will help in the &quot;user testing&quot; exercise.</p> <h3 id="user-testing"><a href="#user-testing" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> User Testing</h3> <p>For this exercise, you will be grouped up with other students to analyze each other's wireframes. I will post groups here when ready.</p> <p>Typically, you would do user testing on a finished or nearly finished site or application. However, I want to do this exercise because now is a good time to get some feedback on your wireframes before you advance into a more complete and complex design.</p> <p>Someone other than you should be operating the computer and going through your wireframes. Switch up the &quot;driver&quot; for each member of the groups review.</p> <p><strong>Your role when looking at another’s wireframes:</strong> Okay, these aren’t real sites, they may or may not clickable, but you should still be able to look at the wireframes, and imagine yourself clicking through. Look through the wireframes and describe what you see, what you think certain parts of the page are for. If you can't tell, ask.</p> <p><strong>Your role when you’re showing your wireframe:</strong> Walk your group through your brief and sitemap quickly, pointing out which pages you've wireframed. As the driver points things out in your wireframes or asks questions. Answer, but pay attention when your answer seems to be need a lot of explanation. It should be obvious what the items on your page are for. If you don’t have an answer, or it takes an inordinate amount of explaining...congrats, you’ve just found an improvement you can make through our facsimile of user testing.</p> <p>Collect information from your user testing session, make any necessary adjustments, and make sure you have included the necessary items on your InVision board as noted below.</p> <p>If you find your wireframes need more work than you can complete in class, feel free to take another period to refine them as you start your styletiles.</p> <div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Due Date</p> <p>Wireframes due &amp; user testing exercise: Monday 4/15</p></div> <h2 id="style-tiles"><a href="#style-tiles" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Style tiles</h2> <p>The next step is to develop a &quot;Style Tile.&quot; This will allow us to define the look and feel of our site, and quickly iterate changes, rather than start with a complex, full-page. design. This allows us to efficiently show the look and feel of the site as a whole, rather than focusing on one particular page.</p> <p>We’re going to continue to approach this project with the idea that it is a large complex web project, even though we’re only touching bits and pieces. As you can probably imagine, it would be a vast and complex undertaking to design an entire large site by having an Illustrator file for every single page and possible configuration of a site. Instead, developing style tiles, style guides, and wireframes—along with careful art direction—can be an efficient way to get a project up and running. It’s also a great way to begin showing a client work, without too much initial time investment.</p> <h3 id="what-s-a-styletile"><a href="#what-s-a-styletile" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> What's a &quot;Styletile&quot;?</h3> <p><strong>Audience</strong>: Although style tiles are great for communicating amongst a design and development team, the ultimate audience for them is the client.
