## JMS Reporting
- meeting about some campaign changes

## Admin
- Looking into Imgix usage and warnings about how we might exceed our plan
- okta setup on a new phone

## Site Template
- start pagination on the Whipstir import plugin

## CK Video Upload
- start up a new WP site
- setup Amazon to store the files uploaded via Gravity Forms, but, that doesn't work, as GF doesn't use the normal media library
- asking if they would want to use Dropbox instead

## JMS Magento Decommission
- make final changes in production CMS
- image issue, looks like spaces in image file names on Pimcore also screw up srcset generation

## Site Template
- get back to pagination attempts
- struggling...
- working, had to remove the delete function, which should have been obvious, will need to separate out that task
