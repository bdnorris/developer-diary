## GRNCRFT Check
The setting for posts per page was set as 6, with the intention you would see 6 blog posts per page. But as far as WordPress is concerned, products are just posts as well. So I had to add a bit of code that would ignore this when youâ€™re looking at a product archive.
```php
add_action('pre_get_posts', function($query){
	if ( is_archive('product') ) {
		// show all despite the number set under "blog pages show at most"
		$query->set( 'posts_per_page', -1 );
	}
});
```
- update plugins and WP version
