## Site Template
- css cleanup
- mixin changes
    - didn't realize one of my mixins only worked because the media query inside was also a mixin, but normally you can't put media queries inside a mixin.
- filter app is not showing categories/terms for recipes when built, works in dev though...?
    - it was the wrong "mode", I had "recipes" instead of "recipe"

## JMS All Spreads / Maintenance
- recipe API 500 error
- products have been removed, replaced with temporary ones for now, will need to replace with the real ones later.
