## JMS OCS Updates
- QA in JMS staging
- My persona switcher is breaking product fetching :(
	- I didn't realize that products were refetched per persona, I thought they were just from a group of tags, rerunning the fetch when forcing the persona update fixed it.
- Still having issues with scrolling to top from that persona switcher.
	- fails sometimes whether I'm using Zenscroll or just native scrolling
	- adding a little delay of 100ms seems to fix it, page is maybe still re-rendering too much
- force download also having issues
	- just use window.open()
- fix the thank you background sizing
