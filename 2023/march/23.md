## VNTR Forms
- realized I was not properly formatting my form data, changed
`const formData = new FormData()`
to
`const formData = new URLSearchParams()`

That fixed the field issue, but I can't get a response from the server that I can parse. It's "opaque".

Thinking of making a serverless function for all of these and another project I'm working on.
