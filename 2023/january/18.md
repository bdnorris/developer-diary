## VNTR MLFRY
- launch

## TMZ Website
- back to PDFs
	- confirm even just downloading doesn't work
	- found the issue in stack exchange, so at least I'm not alone
- look at APIs and pricing
- meeting
- research APIs more
- see if I can get some logs from WPEngine that would tell me what the PDF usage per month is

## JMS Maintenance
- 1850 bugfix merge request to master
- need to do a maintenance merge request to staging
- done!

## TMZ Website
- get logs from WPEngine
- so, yeah, a lot of PDFs, API is likely not going to work, too expensive
- start a redo in dompdf
- ALSO DOESNT WORK WITH DEV MODE OFF

## put in time
