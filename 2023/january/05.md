## TMZ Website
- test production environment
- most things working, except forms had an issue, had to "repair the database"
	- possibly related to "Craftâ€˜s CSRF validation"
- email notifications not working
	- sent a support request
- testing imports
	- found another failure, null value being submitted to a string function, added a check and trying the import again

## JMS Maintenance
- mostly HTML issues

## TMZ Website
- search issues, mostly just limitations
