## JMS 1850 LP Issues
- code is deployed, looks good!
- log in to Vimeo to help S find a shareable link of the "sizzle" video.

## GRNCRFT Website
- get and format all the form names and their IDs to put into Jira
- make a new generic event tag in GTM
- make a helper function to send these events
- add to the "u w" tool on the site
- try and use the same function to track location selection on the map
	- try and distinguish between clicking on the map or clicking on the location list
	- nope, tried a custom event but maps isn't picking it up. Not worth the time.
- track the mobile in page jump menu
- my generic link tracker captures hashes on the destination parameter
- found a good summary of GA4 events and why I do in fact need to add custom dimensions to match my custom parameters

## VEN HVR Website
- add another button to the home page that opens the form drawer
- hide the button attached to the form drawer until it's open, then relabel it "close"
- update the logo and styling related to logo size and position

## HLF Gateway
- investigating why someone can't login and can't reset their password
	- they were set as "inactive" in the database
	- their email address has changed from what's set
		- I don't have the ability to change their email address

## JMS Maintenance
- check on staging merge request
	- no movement

## PSP DigIn Mobile
- not clear to me what's being asked for
- if I get a response, I might start a new cleaner repo for these type of pages that get integrated with the client CMS

## Jira cleanup

## TAP Website
- check-in on people and case studies
- send M some links to see if she can review or if there is a technical issue

## JMS Maintenance
- environment writeup
- didn't finish

## GRNCRFT Analytics Meeting
- meeting to review

## JMS 1850
- ugh, forgot to make sure validation works on required stuff, and it doesn't
- no idea why, but native validation is being blocked by reCAPTCHA
	- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41665935/how-can-i-process-html-form-validation-before-recaptchas-validation
	- I can't find a way to make it work, so adding my own
- added required, but should check email, telephone, and highlight invalid fields
