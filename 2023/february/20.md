## JMS JF PC Updates
- finalize main page
- a bit of browser testing
- the iframe keeps on pulling focus, I need to check on that
	- and it needs to be a bight taller on mobile

## TMZ Handoff
- finalizing the hosting transfer

## JMS JF PC Updates
- can't figure out how to prevent the iframe from pulling focus and scrolling the page. It seems to be because of the form field that's hooked up to v-model, but even when setting it to be what we want by default, loading still scrolls the page.
- starting contact form page for now.
- working on the form
- looks like they're wanting some halfway internationalization, probably not going to work, pushing-back
- seeing if I can get the form hooked up to existing scripts
- pretty much working, but need to match Pardot field names
- had to go into Pardot and remove spaces, working now
