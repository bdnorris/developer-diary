- trying to setup a new repo so that I can generate html for the site more effectively and predictably
- pain in the butt, what I really want to use is nunjucks, but it's not as popular as things like pug, I can't get parcel to work, so I think I should just go with Gulp.

## JMS JF PC Updates
- replace header video/animation
- putting into the review

## PSP Maintenance

## JMS JF PC Updates
- small text update
	- well, actually, can't superscript here directly, maybe if I return raw html in the template
	- that worked
- investigate "keeping a phrase on the same line" request
- resized resources in docker
- having to re init my local. 
	- failing, it can't find the image :(
	- reaching out to TR, who apparently owns that image has just removed it from his account :(
	- he's being super helpful, but since he hasn't built this docker image in years, it's having some package issues
	- updated a composer-merge package
