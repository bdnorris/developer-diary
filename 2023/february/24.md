## JMS Retainer
- T had a good idea, since we have a working image on the server, I should be able to push it directly up to docker hub w/o having to build it.
- looks like the feature server image actually belongs to E, while the local was pointing to T's account. No idea if there is a meaningful difference there. I'm going to try and push up E's image and see if it works locally.

`docker image tag 77f91898ad50 marlinnetwork/jms-pimcore-5-feature:latest`
`docker push marlinnetwork/jms-pimcore-5-feature:latest`
- did not work locally, same issue "unused bindings", maybe it's not the image after all, maybe it's that ssl removal from earlier in the process.
- restored composer.lock from the server, everything installs ok, but that image from the server needs a proxy I think
- testing making a new feature environment with the copied image
