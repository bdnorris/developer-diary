## JMS JF PC Updates
- add form fields to contact page
- add a basic form to the main page, add a function that watches for the thank you message, if it sees it, it auto-clicks a link to download the pdf
- waiting on actual form design, the pdf, etc.

## Team Meeting

## Semi-Annual Review

## JMS JF PC Updates
- matching form to design
- would like to upload some new assets to all environments, but when I try to get on the VPN I never get my text code
- adding them to our staging enviro
- busting the cache and putting into review

## JMS Maintenance
- modifying some link code to allow the user to set if the link should open in a new tab or not

## Training
- playing with Strapi and render.com
	- giving up, SQLite isn't something I would use in the real world anyway, and getting it to work on Render seems like a pain
- design to dev guide work
