- nope, it seems to be something where the normal `pimcore_image` call is not showing the correct url when it renders the markup. 
	- If I instead put the image in an `if editmode` block, and then write the image html myself using `pimcore_image("imageName").getSrc()` it works. So that getSrc() method is working.
- work through these blocks with hovers
