## Reading more on Servd

## PIL LP Updates
- content
- capturing UTM codes in the form

## Team Meeting

## BSH Homepage Updates
- asking a question regarding whether or not the new main homepage banner should be segmented.

## More craft testing with SERVD
- still worried a bit about form submissions, but Production _should_ end up as the source of truth anyway. If not, perhaps we could just export form entries into Google Sheets natively or by using Zapier until they get a CRM.

## TMZ Wireframe Meeting
- came out with some questions about what data will be in the APIs
	- 1WS we can't say for sure because we don't have access
	- WS I can ask the team

## More Craft testing
- basics all going well
- had to turn off "Use gRPC FUSE for file sharing" in Docker settings after having some issues with Nitro finding templates.

## PIL 
- shrink the top so that people with small screens can see the form
