## JMS 1850 LP
- button update

## JMS Sweetners LP
- realized the issue with the thank you was some code that was added to hide form content in p tags. But this was also selecting the p tags inside the thank you message. Instead of improving the selector, I just added code to unhide p tags inside the thank you message.

## NN Estimate
- confusing PDF about how to add some iframe and form code to a website for some rewards program verification. Confusing, because at first it seems like you are submitting a form to an endpoint, then the iframe shows the results, but a lot of the sample code shows the form as being hidden with hidden fields. Seeking clarifcation.
