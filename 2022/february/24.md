## BSH Versatility
- possible issue with iOS not loading my Vimeo iframes

## Team Meeting

## BSH Recipes
- getting organized and downloading files
- screwed up the DB
I wanted to import prod -> dev, but setup an import from dev -> prod, realized my mistake and canceled it. Then set it up the right direction. But apparently even though there is a “cancel” button, it just leaves the database broken, so my second import was copying a broken database into a good one, breaking both. I really don’t know what that cancel button is good for. Backups are on a separate deployment on the west coast, but they were slightly out of date.
- adding back those missing recipes
- fixing groups
- importing prod back into dev
- start fixing up JSON files for new recipes
- added them to the DB
