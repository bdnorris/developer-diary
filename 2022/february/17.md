## PLG PRC
- trying to figure out what's going on with form submissions not recording campaigns, for the most part
- not finding any clues in analytics
- all Google ads are using www, netlify is saying there's an issue with www
- pulling up the DNS, I'm seeing that they still have A records on www along with the CNAME. No idea what this does but I emailed their IT to get those removed.

## Team Meeting

## PLG PRC
- not finding any reason in particular the google ads aren't getting recorded, but my code does measure the parameters on submission, so I may try and record those on mount instead. 
- of course, it's because they stuck a fragment in the URL, but it wasn't at the end, so although Google can still read the parameters, the browser can't.

## TMZ Wordpress Import
- had to do some config, but basically worked. Assets are the big issue, it wasn't able to make assets out of featured images. 
- could perhaps use some kind of downloader app and grab all the images from the CSV and upload those.
