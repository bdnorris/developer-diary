## SHF Updates
- ugh, why did I update Local app. Big mess now, won't pull sites. Will probably have to delete the site and do it over again if I want Local to pull, or, wait until it gets fixed. Not a huge deal today.
- Updated a grid section to flexbox so it will center items.

## Team Meetings

## JMS Sweeteners Kickoff
- new landing page, but not totally new. Shouldn't be too bad.

## HLF Spotlight
- ok, so an Umbraco update has deprecated the way we had a thing setup, so a very simple job just got more complicated.

## DFA Pardot Templates
- Going to make a new section in their MJML template for Pardot.
