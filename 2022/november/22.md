- one more update
- update was easy, but the staging server is messed up, it's asking for a password
	- ssh key is there
	- user was deleted
	- restoring 3 day old backup: nope
	- restoring 10 day old backup: nope
	- restoring 17 day old backup: no no no
	- snapshots: no
	- users files are gone in all backups? Are backups not actually restoring?
