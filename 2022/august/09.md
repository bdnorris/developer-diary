## TMZ Website
- 1ws issue seemed to just be images that were too large, instead of throwing an error an moving on, they are getting stuck. 
	- solution for now is to manually download the tricky images and upload them to the site into the proper directory, that way, they'll get skipped. 
- product PDFs
	- moving along, except my nutrition tables have inconsistent font sizes and I'm not at all sure why

## TMZ Maintenance
- updates to some current content
