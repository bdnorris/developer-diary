## TMZ Website
- figure out product PDF tables
	- seemed like it was choking on named HTML entities
	- numerical ones are more reliable
	- simplified the tables as well
	- padding for indentation no longer working, so using non-breaking spaces does work. Just can't use nbsp, have to use the number.
