## Found on KRG that on a blog post they added a "sources" section and spelled out the links. In chrome, links won't break, causing them to run off their section and make weird margins. 

```css
overflow-wrap: break-word;
```

...will work, but I'm checking if it makes more sense to just not have the links like that.

## SBX Analytics documentation, found a bad category for `PartnerUniversity` that should be `Partner University` that I'm just going to fix.
- It was in Umbraco! Fixed.

## A bit of time on Front-end guidelines

## C's Jira 201 Training

## TAP stuff
- preloading
- lazy loading
- airtable connection for
  - forms
  - error tracking

## Attempted Error tracking with Airtable. Unclear if it's working, going to be hard to debug with console logs.
- Can't quite get this to work. It doesn't seem to be actually firing anything on error. Tabling for now. Tried...

```js
window.onerror = function(error) {}
// and
window.addEventListener('error', function(error) {})
```

## Just thinking, maybe one dev day we should just all share our coding extensions.

## Airtable for simple form works well, will try a file upload next
- looks like this isn't possible. You have to have a full URL first. Maybe I can use Filestack or Imgur according to this [article from airtable](https://community.airtable.com/t/is-it-possible-to-upload-attachments/188)
- More likely, I'll need to use S3 or something like that.
