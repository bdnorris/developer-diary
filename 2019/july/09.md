## Working on testing GRF forms, realized no SMTP is setup yet, installed that plugin and using Amazon SES to send.

## Scanning SMK for 404's, found a bad link in the mobile nav, but that's it.

## Finishing testing GRF forms, also needed to change permissions on the `wp-content/uploads/gravity-forms` directory so file uploads worked.

## Moving along with CON newsletter job. Making a gulp that puts your styles in the head.
- This was a success, works well. 
- Uses [gulp-style-inject](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-style-inject)

## Breaking to deal with some PL Updates

## Met about Pardot landing page analytics strategies

## Wrote up design challenges regarding CON newsletter job

## Working a bit on TAP before I have the go ahead on anything else, going to work on filtering. 
- Fixed previous issue with getting filters (I was only getting the first thing from each item, not everything)
- Otherwise, worked on filter button styles.
