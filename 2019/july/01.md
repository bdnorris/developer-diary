## Put my time in from closed days and the holiday

## Researched commenting and planned an estimate for media routing
- Replybox is nice and simple, waiting on a reply of whether you could have more than one per page. I think its possible you could manually reload the iFrame and bring up a different comment thread.
- Disqus is the similar, except they do have an actual .reset() method for this. Can't load more than one at a time though.
- They have similar pricing ~$10/month

## Made new brick for JMS

## Starting GRF project
- Couldn't get very far, have very little information.
  
## Finished first draft of analytics training
- Need to polish, more screenshots?
- Could this be my first DEV.to article?
- made a [github repo for this](https://github.com/bdnorris/tag-manager-base), mostly for the documentation

## Starting TAP Work Filters
- got it working with one at a time, filter as a string gotten prior to filtering. 

As a method in Vue, 

```html
<!-- TEMPLATE -->
<template v-for="(item, index) in data">
  <li v-show="itemIsActive(item)" :key="index">
    <nuxt-link :to="'/work/' + rawData[index].uid">
      <h3>{{ Dom.RichText.asText(item.title) }}</h3>
    </nuxt-link>
    <div v-html="Dom.RichText.asHtml(item.summary)" />
  </li>
</template>
```

```js
// METHODS
itemIsActive(item) {
  return item.services.find((s) => {
    return s.service.uid === this.activeFilter || this.activeFilter === ''
  })
}
```
