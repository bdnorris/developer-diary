## Making image specs for CON landing page

## Great [Rachel Andrew talk on talking about CSS Layout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqYWDGzhZKM)

## Used Survey Monkey for this CON thing, pretty nice interface and the iFrames are reasonably responsive.

## Reviewing H's work on TAP.

## Adding prismic stuff to the people view.

## GRF feedback, mostly just copy changes. Found that Migrate DB for Wordpress lets you save search and replace profiles, which is nice.
