## Picking up on Griffith Microsite. Adding ReCaptcha to Gravity Forms, turning on GForms CSS, dealing with programatic and node ordering
- One issue is that the programmatically created repeater always wants to be last, but I want reCaptcha to be last. Using this code to swap them after dom load.

```js
// swap captcha and repeater
var form = document.getElementById('gform_fields_1');
form.childNodes[20].parentNode.insertBefore(form.childNodes[20], form.childNodes[19]);
```

## Reminder, `<input type="submit" />` style buttons don't allow pseudo elements. 

## Worked on my analytics dev training. Revised the draft.

## Making one or two more examples for analytics dev training.
- made a basic modal with spots for tracking.

## Looked at Pardot landing pages
- basically works on templates you edit in the page, then you use `pardot-region` attributes and %%--%% to make something editable.
- Found a PDF with more information
- Thinking of tracking this, maybe a custom gulp build that puts your stylesheet in the head of your document?
