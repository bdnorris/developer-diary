## Starting the day off with meetings and discussions.

## Waiting on CON login, so working on the TAP site, making my filters additive.

Probably the first time I've used `findIndex`. It's in core-js, so I think we're ok.

```js
applyFilter(filter) {
  if (this.activeFilter.includes(filter)) {
    const index = this.activeFilter.findIndex((a) => { return a === filter })
    this.activeFilter.splice(index, 1)
  } else {
    this.activeFilter.push(filter)
  }
},
```

## Wait, do I have [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) on this project?

## Analytics training done

## Rework on GRF, mostly text changes and a few new fields

## Really starting CON landing page job. Got Pardot credentials.
