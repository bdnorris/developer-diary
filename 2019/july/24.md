## back on TAP
- [Reading-time](https://github.com/ngryman/reading-time) is really nice and easy to use. Had to run through some code and build a string to provide it with the whole blog.

```js
let textChunk = ''
thought.data.article.map((t) => { textChunk += t.text })
thought.data.body.map((b) => {
  if (b.slice_type === 'article_section') {
    b.primary.text.map((p) => { textChunk += p.text })
  }
})

const readTime = readingTime(textChunk)
```

## Discussed GRF Digital Ocean issues. Maybe it was because somehow two staging containers were running at the same time?

## Dealt with terrible e-mail files B is getting for a certain client. CMYK Illustrator files that somehow are supposed to be e-mails.

## on TAP, ended up using slices for the blog too.

## Watched this Uncle Bob video in our lunch and learn
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_TH-Y78tt4](The Principles of Clean Architecture by Uncle Bob Martin)

## TAP, using readingTime again, should probably make it a component.
- I did.
