## SMC Brick Edits

## Long SBX Asset Audit from US

## Reviewed Umbraco Grid Editor with E for use on MSV.

## Back to TAP, really tough issue with the if statement on a sub-api call. What I was checking was true sometimes, even if there was nothing there. 

changed 
```js
-      if (service.data.testimonial_group) {
+      if (typeof service.data.testimonial_group[0].testimonials.id !== 'undefined') {
```

## Chatted with C about SVG Animation and "Bodymovin"

## Pushed BSH changes to staging, and then to production

## Worked with H on Prismic queries. Made a query based on a previous query and the relationships setup on the second query.

```js
const works = await api.query([
  Prismic.Predicates.at('document.type', 'work'),
  Prismic.Predicates.at('my.work.people.person', person.id)
])
```
