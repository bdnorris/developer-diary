## Working on adding real content into TAP, noting differences and new needs.

## WIP Meeting, need to work on Goals

## Kickoff for internal project, exciting stuff.

## Weekly dev meeting where I presented notes from Uncle Bob's talk.

## Working on TAP gallery
- have to juggle a bunch of stuff here... 'show' logic needs to be on the parent component, and i've set it up to bass a single object or an array of objects.

## Going to push further on media routing for just a bit.
- working with routing, but its just using the unique id, need to make a custom unique id in strapi to use instead and make sure the strapi restful filter stuff works with it.
- that works, now I need to make a component with a field for entering the identifier, then maybe a password as well. Then try adding additional sections.
