## Duplicating a bunch of fake CMS stuff on TAP so I can test "Load More" on blogs.

## Used pagination and an async call to make load more actually load more, problem is, that won't work with filtering. Will need to build this into the filter list instead.

## Got something better, but I need to change the check from a compare of index and top load to a current count. Need to make a current count. 

## Off to Tulsa for Uncle Bob Event
