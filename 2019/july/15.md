## For CON, working on a GTM custom javascript variable to capture img alts if the link is an image rather than text.

```js
function() {
  if ({{Click Element}}.children.length > 0) {
    return {{Click Element}}.children[0].alt;
  } else {
    return {{Click Element}}.innerText;
  }
}
```

## Back on TAP, used grid span really effectively for the first time.
- The designer used a 12 column grid, so it was easy to use this to size items.

```scss
@supports (display: grid) {
  display: grid;
  grid-gap: em(28);
  grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr);
  & > li {
    grid-column: span 6;
  }
  & > li:nth-child(n+5) {
    grid-column: span 4;
  }
}
```

## Issue with BSH, classes were copied without being renamed, messing up another landing page. :(

## Started the Svelte tutorial, nice

## Added basic analytics to GRF
