## PLV maintenance

## Checked on GRF upload size limit

## Cleaning up SMK UI Kit branches because redesign effort is complete

## Yesterday, H discovered this automated front-end tester, might be worth exploring
[SmashTest](https://smashtest.io/)

## Working on making TAP filter list more generic so it can list people as well as work

## Launched PLV maintenance

## Re-looked at Fall assets
- They fixed a bug that should have been embedded into an image
- They fixed slides by removing arrows that should not have been in the image

## Back to TAP and making the Filter component generic

## H proved to me that you can just use emoji's as class names and they work just fine.
