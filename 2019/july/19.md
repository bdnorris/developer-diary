## Going to try a proof of concept for routing tool with Strapi and Vue
- renaming content types is such a pain in strapi
- Tried graphql on Vue, got scared, so much setup. Axios for now.
- Crummy code but it works. Will wait for E to make sure staging on Digital Ocean works ok.

## One last change on GRF, then we're launching

## Continuing my Udemy Nuxt course, realize I should probably be using Vuex for my content on TAP
- need to read [nuxt vuex store](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/vuex-store/)
- on second though, I don't know enough about Vuex yet.

## Interview

## Griffith launch, my sidebar widget came back on the thank you page!
- turns out there are issues with the digital ocean ssl proxy, it kicks me out of the wp-admin. E is working on it.
