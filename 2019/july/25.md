## Styling out TAP "thoughts" landing page.

## CON meeting walking through Pardot landing page, adding IDs for in-page links.

## Weird issue on SBX React app with HTML from the CMS, it was adding via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` extra quotes like...

```html
<span class="my-class"> -> <span class=""my-class"">
<!-- so we just put this in the CMS -->
<span class=my-class>
```
and it worked. Something about our URL encoding probably, but haven't had this issue before.

## Wrote one of the most complicated stylesheets I've written in awhile. Going to commit and refactor.

## on TAP, need to check if we're connecting Clients to Work.

## also on TAP, since app "re-hydrates" there will be no such thing as a staging publish.
