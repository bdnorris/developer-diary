## JMS and TAP Check-ins

## GRF WP Admin trouble shooting. 
- Still kicking me out, tried enforcing SSL and checking on .htaccess. No luck. I did confirm the total backup plugin works, so I can bring down a copy from production to local.

## Started the HTML Section of Brad Frost's front end style-guide.

## Quick meeting with G

## Back to TAP case studies

## Moving on to TAP Blog
- Going fine, missed some stuff for awhile because I was sending the query 'person' instead of 'people'.

## GRF Admin issues solved because of a client request, sorta.
- Turns out there is some weird Digital Ocean proxy issue with the staging site, the staging site was receiving some inputs, like a load balancer, kicking me out of admin.
