## Z-index TAP Bug
- actually just needed some padding on the first thing, found a nice workaround for the idea that CSS doesn't have a first-of-classname selector.
- Apply the first thing's styles to the main class:
  - then remove them with a general sibling selector.

```scss
.cs-summary {
  padding-top: 7em;
}
.cs-summary ~ .cs-summary {
  padding-top: 0;
} 
```
