## MNR updates, removing recipes.
- Would have liked to train an intern, but timing is too tight.

## MNR workaround for file uploads being too big.
- Forgot this came up before.
- Solution is to upload a small dummy PDF through the CMS, of the same name as your real one, then manually replace through the file system with your real one.

## Lupe Status

## CNG SEO meeting

## SMK Launched! Really need a sitemap.xml to fix the search since it's using Google. :(

## Lupe Endpoint is up, but first going to try and use vuex getters as a method.
(Vuex Getters)[https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/getters.html#method-style-access] 

## PSI UI/UX Audit meeting

## Getters are driving me crazy. Works so well in client-side, but having issues with Nuxt and initial page load.
- The solution was to put a check in the computed property for the existence of the thing we're passing to the getter. 
```js
  chef () {
    if (this.recipe.chefId) {
      return this.$store.getters['chefs/getChefById'](this.recipe.chefId)
    } else {
      return ''
    }
  },
```
