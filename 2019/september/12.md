## TAP Jira management

## TAP, working through stuff and testing. 
- Home Hero
  - Edge doesn't support Object Fit on Video, so this solution should work

```scss
  & > video {
    object-fit: cover;
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    /* ie edge only gets the following rule */
    @supports (object-fit: cover) and (-ms-ime-align:auto) {
      height: auto;
    }
  }
```

## TAP Odds and Ends
- Working through items in FE Development deliverable and setting to PO Review or Blocking. Lots of cosmetic tweaking for Safari and Edge as well.
- Remove results copy, removing from CMS and fixing CMS documentation.
  - changing styling, adding texture and an angle.
- Doing a client side api call for service data from the CMS in the footer component.
  - nope, doing a call from the Vuex store instead, refactored service calls to use the store instead of recalling services api. Seems to be working well.
- Removing people from Work/case study pages.
- Removing grid span change on work gallery items.
- People filter changes (categories)
- Thought and Thoughts newsletter removal
- double video zigzag thing
- thought alignment - flexbox nesting puzzle
- made new map api and fixed settings
