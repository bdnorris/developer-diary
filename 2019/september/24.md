## TAP People tablet problems

## TAP Browser update?
- used the customizer to get my config correct.
- https://browser-update.org/

## Easter egg front-end design
- no issues, used the UI kit for styles and added another session cookie to track dismissals.

## Lupe UI Kit list for B/S

## TAP scans
- various performance items, but mostly the images from Marlin Network are ridiculously big. Having to redo some.
  - I think they were so big because they were pre Imgix, so that wasn't what was actually being served.
