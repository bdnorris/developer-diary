## TAP, trying to improve some animations
- tried to go back to keyframe animation, but very difficult to get working with indeterminate amount of things to animate. 
- https://javascript.info/js-animation
  - used requestAnimationFrame before logic call, maybe it's fixed the timing?
  - man, no.
  - yes! requestAnimationFrame used to call the next animation once the last one ends.

```js
  mounted () {
    requestAnimationFrame(this.animatePics())
  },
  methods: {
    animatePics () {
      const count = this.rawPerson.data.fun.length
      if (this.currentIndex < count) {
        this.currentIndex = this.currentIndex + 1
      } else {
        this.currentIndex = -1
      }
      requestAnimationFrame(this.animatePics())
    }
  }
```
- NO, this is too much recursion. tabling.
- good stuff here, but don't have time: https://codetheory.in/controlling-the-frame-rate-with-requestanimationframe/
