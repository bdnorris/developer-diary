## Put in time

  - analytics are going to the wrong spot
    - sent e-mail and having E fix.
- determining some kind of system to trigger Easter Egg.
  - documenting
- Discussing

## Lupe - UI/UX handoff. 
  - TODO: make punch list of new requirements

## Easter egg cookie making
- making tasks

## Deploying BSH (style fixes)

## Easter Eggs, actually starting
- extremely slowed down by git subtree issues imposed on us
- finally have a working script to bring changes into the site

## here's a psuedo guid maker for js
```js
  function uuidv4() {
    return 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'.replace(/[xy]/g, c => {
      // eslint-disable-next-line no-bitwise
      const r = (Math.random() * 16) | 0;
      // eslint-disable-next-line no-bitwise
      const v = c === 'x' ? r : (r & 0x3) | 0x8;
      return v.toString(16);
    });
  }
```
based on this, but I copied it from stack overflow
https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuidv4

## here's a good year from now function

```js
 function yearFromNow() {
    const d = new Date();
    const year = d.getFullYear();
    const day = d.getDate();
    const month = d.getMonth();
    const c = new Date(year + 1, month, day);
    // console.log('date', c);
    return c;
  }
```
