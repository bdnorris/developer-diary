## TAP Meeting
- no one came

## TAP Bugfixes with T
- maybe fixed the google maps thing by doing all calls to the google object inside `if (process.browser) {`
- used @support grid to just remove the carousel from IE11.
- other minor CSS stuff. 

## Reviewing more KRG work

## Working with M to get the video working from Prismic on the about page.
