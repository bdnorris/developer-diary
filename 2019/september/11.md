## TAP Site
- fun animations, having major troubles with mouse events and intervals...
- realized the normal page size for a Prismic predicate is 20, so went through and made sure page sizes were big enough.

```js
const works = await api.query(
  Prismic.Predicates.at('document.type', 'work'), { orderings: '[my.work.date desc]', pageSize: 100 }
)
```

## More TAP Site

## Helped H with some scroll based animation starting with lottie. Hairy, but I think we pulled it off with

## Big TAP meeting to discuss final needs

## NST code patch

## TAP entries in JAMN, Style tweaks, finishing home page more stories band, maybe fixed contact page google map bug?
- hard to duplicate, so we'll see.
