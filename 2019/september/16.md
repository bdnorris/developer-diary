## TAP Work image adjustments
- adjusted display, changed thumbnails, then set the thumbnail height to auto and reset all images.

## Dentist :(

## TAP Reviewing and clearing components

  - speed up animation and make sure it waits after page loads ? 
    - done
  - mobile not done :(

## TAP Video background, experiment with treatments

## Dentist :(

## TAP About Page
- lots of refactoring on the people section, and other mobile issues. 

## TAP Contact Page
- not checking form functionality right now
- setup images to swap with map toggle, kinda fixed the map loading issue with an interval, feels like cheating but seems to work.

```js
if (typeof google !== 'undefined') {
  this.initMap()
} else {
  this.mapCheck = setInterval(() => {
    if (typeof google !== 'undefined') {
      this.initMap()
      clearInterval(this.mapCheck)
    }
  }, 1000)
}
```

## TAP 404 Page
