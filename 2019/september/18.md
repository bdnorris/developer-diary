## JMS Estimates for theming campaign pages (color schemes) in Pimcore

## Lupe sprint planning meeting

## TAP various
- replacing youtube with vimeo
- getting 404 assets
- built, but major issues making a netlify specific 404 page. I think the trick was I'm generate routes, but I needed to add the fallback to the config.
  - https://nuxtjs.org/api/configuration-generate/#fallback
- or maybe not, but it's working now.
- Damn, I had my pre-generated routes and Prismic was only returning 20 (default). Changed it to allowing 100 instead.

## Leadership meeting
- Going to find a plan to put more structure to WFH.

## TAP cleanup
- finished finding clients and testimonials
