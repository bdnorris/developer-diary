## Working with Cookies more

## Stopped to check on some TAP copy fitting and make some type adjustments

## Back to cookies, struggling a bit w/ appending values rather than just making new cookies

## A nice cross-browser document ready check. Lost the reference :(

```js
function docReady(fn) {
  // see if DOM is already available
  if (
    document.readyState === 'complete' ||
    document.readyState === 'interactive'
  ) {
    // call on next available tick
    setTimeout(fn, 1);
  } else {
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', fn);
  }
}
```

## Just making different cookies rather than trying to append. 

## TAP Meeting
- Friday code/content complete
- Launch next Tues/Wed

## Lupe sprint planning

## JMS Easter eggs
becoming clearer, you can't update cookies, you have to remove then add a new one.

- found ultimately that I was trying to set a sitewide cookie with `path="/"` when it should have just been `path=/` with no quotes.

## Back to TAP
- removed work filters by just adding checking the "filtertype" in v-show, hiding them but not actually disabling them.
- video stuff works well, but unclear on color "treatment"
