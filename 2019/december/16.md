## Trying to clear up GA stuff regarding PG

## Checking merges on JMS
- JMS says no images in source control, whatever. Removing SL and will have to re-think.
- Made a new twig extension that doesn't do string replacement, since the apps path happens to be the same as the asset path, just referencing the image with `../../../`, which fails in dev, works once you install. 
- Need to use image path as a string, otherwise webpack tries to load it...
