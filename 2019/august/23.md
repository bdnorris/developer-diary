## Worked on some styling and playing with more grid stuff on lupe.

## Met on TAP site and discussed missing content and timeline

## On lupe, adding the idea of sections to the mock data structure.

## Finding BSH port that is blocked on our network to try and get this fixed.

## Estimates for CNG SEO Full audits

## Finishing data structure changes and refactoring

## Attempting a mixin for max-line length based on ems.
- only needs to be a mixin for convenience. I think 32em is a good max line length.

```scss
@mixin good-measure() {
  max-width: 32em;
}
```

## Learning about css scoping and how weird it can be. I had to do this to make styling a nested thing work in some component scoped css

```scss
.recipe__description {
  grid-column: span 2;
  /deep/ p {
    @include good-measure;
  }
}
```

## Worked with M on off canvas nav panel for lupe

## Added controls component as well
- this will ultimately be a bit trickier, as the controls component and the avatar need to exist as once component instance on desktop and mobile. A fixed position layout may be appropriate, with it being a partial flyout menu on mobile.

## looking into a lottie animation issue in edge. Might be an SVGs complex mask. Waiting on another task to look closer.

## Adding smaller PDFs to MNR, N is looking into updating the uploads quota

## Reviewing TAP People data entry, cleaning up and adding more undefined checks.
