## Working on TAP home page sections

## JSM Launch meeting

## [I like this mobile menu animation](https://www.usarice.com/about-us)

## USR e-commerce meeting

## TAP Blog status --> need to provide fonts

## Researching USR form and Paypal integration possibilities

## GF huge issue, one of my programmatically created fields isn't saving. Opened up a support ticket with Gravity Forms.
- Solved temporarily by copying the form and just making an open field.
