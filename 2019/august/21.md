## Trying to figure out what's wrong with ESLint on my TAP Nuxt project
- not clear what was wrong, but I updated my project with configurations from a newer project, and now I'm getting the same errors as H is. So at least we're on the same page.

## Working on one more strategy for API calls in Nuxt using Vuex
- [great post about this stuff](https://itnext.io/efficiently-understanding-and-using-nuxt-vuex-7905eb8858d6)

## Dev lunch, rewatched Tom's old gitflow presentation
[SGF Web Devs Gitflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um3KU3XFM3M)

## Lupe status, new features and ways to think about data structures. New UI designs for creation.

## Adding new features to lupe backlog

## Netlify lupe build working. Turned out I just pointed it to the wrong repository.

## Worked with H on TAP prismic stuff, saw that I missed some undefined checks and fixed.
I need to start putting code samples back in here!

```js
const ctaRef = thought.data.body.find((t) => {
  return t.slice_type === 'cta'
})

let cta = null
if (typeof ctaRef !== 'undefined') {
  cta = await api.getByUID('calls_to_action', ctaRef.primary.call_to_action.uid)
}
```

## Spun up M on BSH and deploying a small change

## Making Jira tasks for missing content pieces on TAP case studies

## Adding more undefined checks to TAP case studies
