## Checked JMS OG Tags, looks like the URL can't be relative. 

## Apparently, Netlify will warn you by email if you have mixed content on a secure site. Not actually an issue in this case, but good to know. 

## MVP Lupe meeting
- defined minimal
- started notion account
- test fonts for fractional characters

## TAP Wistia - getting vids and thumbnails
- apparently, thumbnails were already there and could be downloaded

## JMS Small change
- for some reason, we set a font style on the `<a>` element. Going to try `inherit` instead.

## Nuxt and Jest, trying some more stuff
