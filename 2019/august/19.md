## Investigating TAP blog Hubspot functionality
- looks like it just pulls in some other Umbraco content, I can make a slice in Prismic to duplicate this.
- Actually, I'll make it it's own type then add a relationship slice
- Paired with the interns and went over content migration.
- Successful!

## Speaking to B about data structure

## GRF Formstack fix
- made it so emails couldn't be duplicate, but they want a person to be able to submit more than one.

## JMS Open Graph image fix

## Lupe API Architecture fix

## Looks like you can actually init a vuex action on the server-side with nuxt. 
- [Nuxt Server Init Action](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/vuex-store#the-nuxtserverinit-action)
- [Nuxt Axios Module](https://axios.nuxtjs.org/usage)
- This works!

## Found I can populate the store on mount and everything works just fine. Vuex will RESET with page refreshes. So every page route needs to be responsible for populating the store.
