## Debugging SMK Landing page lottie animation in Edge. Guessing it was a SVG mask issue, and D agreed. Re-exported from After Effects w/o the mask and now it works.

## Discussed SMK site launch and S3 issues.

## Finished SMK search console and GTM tasks, for now. 

## Finding something for M to do on TAP. Picked the Contact page.
