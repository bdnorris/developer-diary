## Guidelines work

## Working with Cloudinary for file uploads
- going well, a bunch of pieces have to work together though
- Success, the Airtable api documentation on attachments is a bit confusing, since it accepts an array by default and I was under the impression it was just one thing.
- Working, would like to refactor a bit and add some authentication. Then ask some people to help test. Need better error checking as well.

## Replying to WooCommerce question
- might need to do an estimate next week

## TAP File uploads working fine, but got way off track because of a reCaptcha issue.

## Quick PLV update
