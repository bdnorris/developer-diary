## Researching rich text editors for Guadalupe

### Quill
- [Quill](https://quilljs.com/docs/quickstart/)
- Says it's extensible, vanilla JS, comes with a set of themes, open source
- Good set of rich text editing
- methods for getting and putting content
- [210k](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=quill@1.3.6)
- IE11 Support

### Trix
- [Trix](https://trix-editor.org/)
- From the basecamp people, open-source
- IE11 Support
- Kinda weird, you load in content via a hidden input's value, rather than an API
- lots of features, but the api is less straightforward
- [218k](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=trix@1.2.0)

### ProseMirror
- [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/)
- Open source
- IE11 Support
- Divided into smaller components so you only use the features you need
- Less features though
- Robust API
- Hard to say what final bundle size would be

### Squire
- [Squire](http://neilj.github.io/Squire/)
- minimal, really an add-on for textarea. In my browser, Grammerly recognizes it and kicks in.
- IE11 ok
- basically just edits an HTML file through an iFrame?
- [only 50k](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=squire-rte@1.9.0)
- but probably not robust enough for us

### simditor
- [simditor](https://simditor.tower.im/)
- larger at [380k](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=simditor@2.3.27), but claims it's really fast
- It's jquery :(
- also utilizes `textarea`
- not a ton of methods

### Trumbowyg
- [Trumbowyg](https://alex-d.github.io/Trumbowyg/)
- honestly, going to skip it since it's a jQuery dependency
- well, man, it's so small though [25k](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=trumbowyg@2.18.0)
- jquery is at 86k minified, so that's like 110.
- lots of plugins
- (Vue version)[https://github.com/ankurk91/vue-trumbowyg]

## Front-end stack research for Guadalupe
- Do we need to support IE11?
- Could we throw some money to some open source things?
- what does the home page look like with no trends?

### Nuxt
- obvious choice based on my experience
- [PWA Support](https://pwa.nuxtjs.org/)
- MIT Licensed
- Try using typescript in vue?
- Try moving more styles into components

### Next.JS
- maybe look into it, Facebook is still a turnoff for me.

### Vue.JS
- plainer vue start?

### Svelte
- probably too big of a learning curve for now

### Angular
- lack of Website schtuff is what hurts here

### Another web thing with Angular or Vue apps inside?

## Refactoring my Cloudinary and Airtable work on TAP from last week. Adding filesize check, adding e-mail notification.
- Email not working. :(

## Company meeting

## TAP, trying out real thought content, noting things to style.

## Backlog grooming meeting for Lupe
