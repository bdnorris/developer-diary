## Checking out some Adobe fonts for wireframing on Lupe
Liking...
- [Acumin](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/acumin)
  - lots of weights AND widths
  - not sure it looks great small
- [Tablet Gothic](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/tablet-gothic)
  - also lots of weights AND widths
  - looks better smaller
- [Calluna](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/calluna) [Sans](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/calluna-sans)
  - I liked this one going back to when all of exljbris stuff was free. 
  - serif is not great small
  - sans looks good small though
  - old style numerals on the sans is nice
- [Nimbus](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/nimbus-sans?red=a) [Roman](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/nimbus-roman?red=a)
  - looks good small but in a sorta boring way, but maybe boring's good.
- [Coranto](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/coranto-2?red=a)
  - maybe for pairing with something
- [Soleil](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/soleil?red=a)
  - I like it, looks good small
- [Benton Sans](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/benton-sans?red=a)
  - yes, also looks good small
  - serif for pairing (Benton Modern Display)[https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/benton-modern-display?red=a]
- [Franklin Gothic](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/franklin-gothic-urw?red=a)
  - lots of widths
- [Proxima Nova](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/proxima-nova?red=a)
  - looks good as expected, modern
- [Skolar](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/skolar?red=a)
  - serif, but looks great small
- [Neue Haas Unica](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/neue-haas-unica?red=a)
  - looks decent small, but maybe not good enough
- [Aktiv Grotesk](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/aktiv-grotesk?red=a)
