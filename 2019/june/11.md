## We scrummed about JMS and talked about images and design
- I need to recheck the product thumbnail settings, not sure they're working.

## I did a bit of research on Umbraco E-commerce solutions
- Ucommerce, Merchello, and Teacommerce all seem promising

## I peer reviewed H's work on PLV site questionnaire.

## I'm demoing Strapi for other senior devs.
- Need to explore GraphQL to avoid having to deal with the entire relationship payload.

## Interviewed Front-end candidate

## Checked on and updated those JMS Thumbnails. 
- In Pimcore, added _Frame_ after _Contain_, then _Set Backgroundcolor_ after that. This gives us the thumbnail we want.

## Interviewed director/sales candidate

## Tried to update Strapi in it's docker image, but this image has the wrong node version, doesn't have curl or apt-get
- Frustrated

## Tried to make my own node docker image with strapi, got it running once, but eh, wouldn't work after restart

## Running strapi locally and connecting to docker mongo db works though.
- Need to discuss deployment options with E.
