## I provided some design direction for checkboxes and found this good NN article.

[NN Checkboxes vs Radio Buttons](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/checkboxes-vs-radio-buttons/)

## Working on some block grid stuff, and concocting some complicated nth-child stuff

- Found some good suggestions here at [nthmaster](http://nthmaster.com/)
- Trying something that will fit with 3, 4, 9, 10, 15, 16, 21...
- This is what ended up working... I didn't realize you can chain nth-child like this.

```scss
&.trend-callout:nth-child(3n+1):nth-child(even),
&.trend-callout:nth-child(3n):nth-child(odd) {
```
- although I do believe `nth-child(6n-2)` or something similar would work as well.

## Tried to help debug why a hash link is linking to the wrong part of a page (SBX).

- no solutions yet. Seems like iOS. 
- discovered it was the products loading, hash works, then things load above it, pushing it down.

## Spent some time testing Strapi with real content.

- finding that the real power is in the relationships datatype
- rich text editor is markdown only, which is fine, but it does deliver in markdown, requiring a plugin to change to HTML.
- although I am worried about more modular based approaches. Maybe content types can be modules and then they can be composed with relationships.

## Spun H up on using forms in Nuxt to implement some changes next week

## Added a facebook pixel to a Nuxt site
- used the plugin architecture
- facebook pixels get blocked by a lot of stuff, used [pixel helper](https://www.facebook.com/business/m/pixel-set-up-step-4) to verify installation
