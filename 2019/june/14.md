## Vetting more CMSs

### Ghost
- Ghost is great for blogs, and does have an API, but it's really designed more for writing, not as much custom, structured, data.

### Craft
- Pricing = Free for 1 user, no support
- If you want more accounts or accounts other than admin, $300 for multi-user / $60 a year for updates
- CraftQL Plugin available for $60
- Installed with Docker
- Backend is pretty nice, they have a type of content called structure that can have a hierarchy
- Installed the plugin [Element API](https://github.com/craftcms/element-api) You have to write the APIs yourself though
- no built in rich text editor, you have to use a plugin like [redactor](https://github.com/craftcms/redactor)

### Contentful
- Fully hosted content management
- $40/month to start, free trial for development though
- Pretty amazing, easy to make content types, API is good
- You do have to requests lists separate from content, but that makes sense
- It's actually free if you only have 1 admin role, but maybe more than one login?
  - ... you get 2 spaces and you get 24 content types
  - but, this is the same as "MICRO"
- [Nuxt tutorial](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/javascript/tutorials/integrate-contentful-with-vue-and-nuxt/)
- Graph QL https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/graphql/

### Keystone JS
- [Keystone](https://keystonejs.com)
- A lot like strapi, but more mature, doesn't make your APIs automatically though.

### Prismic
- A little like contentful, 
- free for one user
- JS library
- Pretty Cool!
- one weird feature, rich text editor uses separate array for html tags
- GraphQL - https://prismic.io/blog/graphql-api-alpha-release

### Statamic
- Very interesting, but not for this project.
- Like wordpress, but no database, all content is rendered out to markdown or yaml
  - unclear how these get published w/o running get commands. 
- $100 for a license [Statamic](https://statamic.com)

### Netlify CMS
- uses netlify infrastructure to work.
- configure types in yml.
- stores markdown files
- really meant for github, since I believe it makes commits for you

### Publii
- https://getpublii.com/
- Uses an app, you keep your files in Dropbox or something
- Super fast it says
  - AMP support
- No API or anything
- have to use a theme
- not clear if you can create custom post types

### Kirbi
- like statamic, it's databaseless
- https://getkirby.com/

## Storyblok
- interesting, could be good, has free tier
- however, it's main boast is a visual editor, or a preview, which I don't fee like we need. 
- digging in, it seems like it's big thing is pages and previews
- has nuxt hookups
- interesting!

## Probably going to go with Prismic
- more pricing tiers if we need them, you get an SLA for way less than Contentful
- [Prismic Nuxt](https://prismic.io/docs/vuejs/getting-started/prismic-nuxt)
- [GraphQL](https://prismic.io/docs/graphql/getting-started/integrate-with-existing-js-project)

## Working on TAP UI Kit
- manually assigned variables to my default-sizing mixin

```scss
$mobile-margin: 1.5625em;
$desktop-margin: 2em;

@mixin default-sizing($max) {
  margin-left: $mobile-margin;
  margin-right: $mobile-margin;
  max-width: $max;
  @include breakpoint(large) {
    margin-left: $desktop-margin;
    margin-right: $desktop-margin;
  }
  @include breakpoint ($max up) {
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
    padding-left: $desktop-margin;
    padding-right: $desktop-margin;
  }
}
```

- this thing is so nice, because it transitions from margins on mobile to padding right when you hit your max-width.
- keeps your margin's the same for the whole project, but, lets you vary your max-widths.
