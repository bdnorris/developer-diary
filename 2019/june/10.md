## I peer reviewed J's work on Minor's Farm to Label page.

## Reviewed design changes on new PLV form.

## Reviewed possible analytics issues on a JMS landing page that's in development. 

- Issue is that AS provided GA and GTM code snippets. The GTM container is completely empty, so only the GA pageview is firing. Typically we wouldn't put GA and GTM on the same page, so waiting on clarification.
