## Dev Lunch Meeting
- D talked about Unity and Vuforia

## Back to Nuxt parameter validation
- realized I was thinking about this all wrong. Validation happens first, before async, so you don't pass bad stuff into your API. Used a regex just to check there are no special characters other than hyphens and underscores instead.

```js
  validate(params) {
    return /^[a-zA-Z0-9-_]+$/.test(params.uid)
  },
```
