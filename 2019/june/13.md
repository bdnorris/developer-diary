## Continued work on JMS Redesign efforts around sizing
- finished up most
- providing two options for featured items, one is awful

## Reviewed Krg Home page work from TCP
- some mobile issues, but main issue was font-weight. 
- Bold fonts were not originally included
- Only semi-bold, and their @font-face declarations had not font-weight settings. Suggested rework here.

## Worked on TAP UI kit
- working on responsive type and overlapping items in the home hero.
- worked on some vertical text by transform rotating and absolute positioning.
  
## I love Vuepress, but I should try [Docusaurus some day](https://docusaurus.io/en/)

## TAP UI kit
- updated my h1 textures for a better fallback, made an data URI so the image is more likely to load, made a default backup, and switch back to transparent inside @supports.

```scss
.heading--texture {
  background-image: url($grit-text-black);
  background-color: $text;
  // background-size: 200%;
  background-position: center center;
  background-clip: text;
  @supports (-webkit-text-fill-color: transparent) {
    -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;
    background-color: transparent;
  }
  // color: rgba($gray, 0.5);
}
```
