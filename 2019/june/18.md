## Trying to figure out route building in Nuxt
- https://nuxtjs.org/api/configuration-generate/#speeding-up-dynamic-route-generation-with-code-payload-code-
- https://www.raymondcamden.com/2019/03/12/an-example-of-nuxtjs-with-a-custom-generator
- [Extremely useful blog from Nebulab](https://nebulab.it/blog/create-fast-nuxtjs-website-prismic/)
- Nothing breaking, but can't seem to get static stuff render
- static stuff rendering, sitemap working
- but, payload doesn't really work for me, it passes data to the static routes, not to the listing of routes. So probably will skip using payload

## Made new prismic account with devops email

## Working on Netlify headers for APIs and to be able to pull fonts from UI kit
- had to edit the UI Kit gulp file to copy `_headers` to `dist`
- switched to toml file. This finally worked.

```toml
[[headers]]
for = "*/*.woff"
[headers.values]
Access-Control-Allow-Origin = "*"
Content-Type = "font/woff"

[[headers]]
for = "*/*.woff2"
[headers.values]
Access-Control-Allow-Origin = "*"
Content-Type = "font/woff2"

[[headers]]
for = "*/*.ttf"
[headers.values]
Access-Control-Allow-Origin = "*"
Content-Type = "font/ttf"
```

## Spun H up on TAP

## Started more Prismic cms + nuxt work
- Got srcset working with prismic thumbnails
- upload the retina image, let it make a thumbnail of the non-retina and let the non-retina be "main"

```vue
  <li v-for="(brand, index) in brands" :key="index">
    <img
      :srcset="brand.brand_image.url + ', ' + brand.brand_image.retina.url + ' 2x'"
      :src="brand.brand_image.url"
      :alt="brand.brand_image.alt"
    >
  </li>
```

## Personal project, my bookmark crud, building an object from tags in an api
- feel like I've stuggled with this before, and gave up. Found a good way o build an object and count duplicates using the find method.

```js
response.data.records.map(t => {
  t.fields.Tags.map(g => {
    if (!this.state.tags.find(o => { return o.name === g })) {
      this.state.tags.push({ name: g, count: 1 })
    } else {
      this.state.tags.find(o => { return o.name === g }).count++
    }
  })
})
```
