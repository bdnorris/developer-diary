## Checking on H's TAP footer work.

## Commenting my slider code.

## Various meetings

## Making outline for analytics development training

## Fixing up Next Service Links

## Meeting on small form job
- need to learn netlify functions for file uploads

## Starting TAP Testimonials, some growing pains when it comes to referencing related content.
- Solution is to Prismic's getById method after building a list of ids from your main api call.

```js
  const tIds = []
  let testimonials = []
  if (service.data.testimonial_group) {
    service.data.testimonial_group.map((m) => {
      tIds.push(m.testimonials.id)
    })
    testimonials = await api.getByIDs(tIds)
  }
```

## Noticed a mixin I was using was using background: inherit for a pseudo element
- I changed it to `background-color: inherit` because I didn't want it to inherit the image, but I hadn't thought about using inherit that way before.
