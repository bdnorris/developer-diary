## Tried more docker/strapi stuff.

## Met with account service about Minor's and how environments and deployments work.

## Lunch and learn with devs, showed my Codepen, and showed off Netlify
- [getters and setters in js for ui control](https://codepen.io/bdnorris/pen/KYjvEd?editors=0010)

## Reviewed PLV site form mongo data, transformed to Excel and tested

## Meeting with Analytics team to talk about process

## Meeting with analytics team to talk about JMS analytics QA
- A couple of items will be put in Jira to work on.
- A few things need to get asked of Account service

## Going to check out GraphQL plugin for Wordpress before I give up on that.
- [WPGraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/)
- [WPGraphiQL](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphiql)
- Works decently, but it is tough to get ACF Fields exposed if they're more than strings. [There's a plugin](https://www.wpgraphql.com/acf/), but it's $50.
