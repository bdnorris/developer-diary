## A couple more changes on PLV SR stores

## Discovered [NCU for updating your package.json from the command line](https://github.com/tjunnone/npm-check-updates)

## Made a component that's just a bunch of SVGs with v-ifs around them to pick the right one. You pass a slug as a prop.
- Works well

## Spun up H on TAP Nuxt project

## Had lunch with CY and he mentioned he's using Strapi in production for clients

## Found out you can check for the existence of slots with Vue

```vue
<div class="paragraph-with-button" v-if="$slots.paragraph">
  <p>
    <slot name="paragraph" />
  </p>
  <nuxt-link :to="buttonLink" class="button hide--mobile">
    <span>
      {{ buttonText }}
    </span>
  </nuxt-link>
</div>
```

## Also learned you can just add a `class=""` to a component and it will add that class to the components root element.
