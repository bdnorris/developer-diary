## Going to work on TAP CMS image specifications
- Never mind, still need to make sure tablet designs are fleshed out before. 

## Going to try and make my carousel's dynamic instead.

## Filtering deeply nested stuff is hard. Here was my solution for matching services that were content relationship with case studies.
- Computed property

```js
matchingWorks() {
  return this.rawWorks.filter((w) => {
    return w.data.services.find((s) => {
      return s.service.uid === this.rawService.uid
    })
  })
}
```

## First time using reduce to flatten an array with only one thing in it. 
- `client_name` was an array with one thing in it.
```js
return client.data.client_name.reduce((n) => { return n }).text
```

## Researched and spoke to E about Wordpress Deployments with Docker, how to handle updates etc. 

## Worked on removing duplicate analytics events on BSH.

## Working on analytics training, need to try using GTM scroll-depth variables sometime. As well as the "Visibility" variables.

## Working on new gulp setup, this was pretty helpful
