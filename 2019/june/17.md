## Worked on JMS Analytics fixes

- Discovered GTM now has a [built in Youtube tracking](https://www.glowmetrics.com/blog/tracking-youtube-videos-via-gtm-in-2018-using-new-built-in-youtube-trigger/).
- Found a good "striphtml" filter for Vue on Stack overflow

```js
Vue.filter('striphtml', function (value) {
  var div = document.createElement("div");
  div.innerHTML = value;
  var text = div.textContent || div.innerText || "";
  return text;
});
```

- Added some code to automatically change the `data-gtmaction` attribute to `download` if the href has PDF, XLS, or XLSX in it.

## Reviewed KRG home page again.

## Trying out a Netlify form with my Nuxt base.
- Basics work really well, but getting asynchronous to work is a bit trickier.
- So it works fine if you want to redirect to a thank you page, but when I try to follow the instructions for asynchronous form submittals, they say to post to the same page, or the home page, however, that always gets a 404 and the form doesn't send through. Tabling this for now.

## Forked my nuxt base for the new TAP site

## Trying to use Prismic GraphQL API with Nuxt
- https://github.com/nuxt-community/apollo-module
- https://github.com/prismicio/apollo-link-prismic
- https://github.com/prismicio/prismic-vue
- Going to give up on GraphQL because of lack of features with prismic, and overall learning curve.

## Installing helper libraries for Prismic
- [Prismic Nuxt](https://prismic.io/docs/vuejs/getting-started/prismic-nuxt)
- Finally got the configuration correct and am getting some data, but I over-installed and have some Prismatic preview stuff I don't necessarily need.
- Need to figure out how to get the data I need smoothly.
