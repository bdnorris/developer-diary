## Moving UI Kit to Nuxt, cancelling UI Kit
- went fairly smoothly

## Starting on Services in CMS and site

## Making "Text Hero"
- data needs to be passed from the page, so if you double next to keep things organized, you need to pass things down twice. I'm thinking this is unnecessary unless something is composed of distinct components.

## Worked a bunch on services, refactored some of the Prismic stuff, now have a reasonable way to access the helper and show text and rich text.

## Fixed flexbox alignment mistake on JMS product categories

## Adding more stores to PLV SR. 

## Worked on TAP Service pages
