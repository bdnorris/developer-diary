## Reviewing Lupe sign in page design
- sketched out an idea for the animation

## Back to JMS Homepage slider
- need to make it so that superscripted Â® will work.
- confusing, but adding the [htmlspecialchars option](https://pimcore.com/docs/5.x/Development_Documentation/Documents/Editables/Input.html) to the editable input works

```php
pimcore_input('txtHeadline', {'htmlspecialchars': false})
```

## Working on coding guidelines a bit

## Looking into more juicer schtuff
Ouch, turns out what they need [isn't actually possible right now](https://help.juicer.io/en/articles/3140285-instagram-hashtag-and-location-changes-updated-july-11-2019)

## Turns out JMS Slider needs to autoplay
- With [Siema](https://github.com/pawelgrzybek/siema), that's not built in, had to make a new instance and add a setinterval that clears when you click. 

## JMS Campaign page experimentation
- Might go with a nuxt solution. Can be put in apps, and if you build to the right directory using `nuxt generate` ->

```
  generate: {
    dir: '../../public/apps/app-name'
  },
```

then can be included inside a blank twig file with
```
{% block content %}
  {{ vueapp('app-name') }}
{% endblock %}
```

## Going to try SL page this way
- mostly working, background images set in css are an issue, they don't get that build directory reference.
