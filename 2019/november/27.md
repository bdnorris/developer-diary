## Going to attempt scroll one more time with zen scroll
- worked as a plugin
  - had to lint to our standards
  - working on safari and ios now
- having issue with this stuff and any client-rendered stuff at all with this setup
  - a little worried about the form we'll have on the next one, need to test that soon

## Helping J with a custom analytics report

## Setting up my next landing page
- need to get a pardot form working in my nuxt-base to copy over.
- might need to update vee-validate
