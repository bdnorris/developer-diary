## Lupe Icons
- still trying to get this to work. getting duplicate icon issues, only sometimes. 
- https://github.com/visualfanatic/vue-svg-loader/issues/90
- Finally found a solution to it and the lack of a consistent box.
  - export from Sketch manually, then _resave in Illustrator_

## Lupe other stuff, 
- CORS errors still an issue. 
- Found out it was really a pre-flight issue. Because we're using a content-type of application/json, it's not a "simple" request. Therefore pre-flight is initiated, but we're not configured correctly for pre-flight. Still up in the air how to do that.

## Lupe, lots of style updates

## TAP Canonical link checking
