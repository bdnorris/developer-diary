## CRB site review
- wp.com site, login isn't working. 
- actually, got in, but doesn't appear like this account can do anything except edit content.

## TSN Juicer thingy. 

## JMS Homepage slider
- completed
- E helped me with the "Block" concept in pimcore, basically a loop you can make inside of a brick. 
- Slider had to be disabled in edit mode, or it wouldn't allow you to type in an input
