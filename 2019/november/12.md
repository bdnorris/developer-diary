## Fixing PGP Link

## Looking at JMS Link
- was just a CSS cacheing issue.

## Duplicate content meeting
- Canonical link back to MN site

## VPN, working
- can't seem to actually access the site though.

## Reviewing PLV new page design
- no mobile
- weird gaps
- didn't want to use XD, so rebuilt in PS?

## PGP Footer Link

## CSI adding TR to WP 
- ended up just exporting myself

## Back to PLV Reviewing

## Typekit migration: TAP

## Typekit migration: BSH
- complete, but push to staging failed

## Trying out Patternlab 3.0
- a bit confused, kits come with sass, but it doesn't compile on it's own, documentation is out of date. 3.0 node version too new?

## Adding DSM to Lupe
