## JMS SL work
- trying to write a shell script to build and install 
  - success
- Didn't realize background-mix doesn't work in Edge. I'll have to make the different images now.
- issues with vue-scroll-to as well, trying to go native with a polyfill.
  - ended up combining 
    - https://www.npmjs.com/package/nuxt-polyfill 
    - and
    - https://www.npmjs.com/package/smoothscroll-polyfill
    - and
    - scrollIntoView method
  - actually, went back to https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-scrollto
  - still not working in Safari
- tabling for now

## Realized I directed N a little incorrectly on HLF grid stuff, fixing myself.

## Commenting on MLF animation issues
