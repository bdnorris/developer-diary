## PGP, figured out issue with E's help.
- It was an unresolved merge conflict IN the form xml, making it bad JSON.
- WTF.
- styling, fixed @font-face rules and added button styles to a mixin.

## Covered Nuxt basics for dev lunch

## PGP, got models to work on feature enviro by manually copying dlls from core projects debug folder to web project. Maybe just a "mode" problem?

## Moving on to Login dropdown for PGP

## Putting bio and photos together for TAP site. 

## Reviewing TAP turnbacks

## More work on PG login form. Local login not working, maybe a web config/cookie issue?
