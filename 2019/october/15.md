## Meeting about PGP lead form status
- was reminded about ReCaptcha issue interfering with my dropdown form. 

## Meeting on video training on JMS equipment
- much more simple now, just one stub page
- still need to figure out where the UI kit lives

## Checking on mailto link in an email issue
- no apparent issues

## Emergency RFP
- documenting current setup

## N had major cacheing issue on PGP
- final conclusion is that there is some kind of date based cacheing on the server, and Gulp was not updating the modified date. 
- Added [Gulp Shell](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-shell) and running a touch command on the main.css file so the date gets updated.
- :(
