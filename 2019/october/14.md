## Check on PLV
- after loosening restrictions, just getting a lot of empty results, one result with a dollar sign in the username.
- will check again tomorrow.

## PGP Web font hosting research
- Will need to put CORS on our site
- They might need to allow us in content-security-policy

## MKB and MNC wordpress backups

## Helping H get MampPro setup and make a new repo for MNC site changes

## PGP Web font fixes and css document sent to third party
- refactored @font-face rules and mixins to use weight instead of names to pull different font files
- prepped css file of rules to send to third party with hardcoded full urls.

## JMS Load more
- blocked because I need a feature branch.
- need to add in testing mode for a product category instead
  - 172 should work (beverages)
- need to modify dev environment to hit localhost api instead of staging.
- borrowed from my Trends code to make this work, changed the list it iterates over to be a computed property that removes filtered items. This would kill animation, but the animation isn't in view usually anyway, since the drawer is so big. 

## PGP Web font email
- replied to email about issues. Made a jamn task to add cors to production server.

## JMS Easter eggs
- merged into review, M is adding items to CMS, so I should be able to review tomorrow. 

## PGP fixup logged in menu

## Review some Lupe
