```js
  data () {
    return {
      isWebP: false
    }
  },
  async mounted () {
    this.isWebP = await this.webP()
  },
  methods: {
    // https://davidwalsh.name/detect-webp
    async webP () {
      if (!self.createImageBitmap) {
        return false
      }
      const webpData = 'data:image/webp;base64,UklGRh4AAABXRUJQVlA4TBEAAAAvAAAAAAfQ//73v/+BiOh/AAA='
      const blob = await fetch(webpData).then(r => r.blob())
      return createImageBitmap(blob).then(() => true, () => false)
    }
  }
  ```
