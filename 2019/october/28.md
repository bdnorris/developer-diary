## Finishing claims for HLF in Umbraco
- color picker bug in Umbraco 7.3 is annoying, the workaround is to use IE11!

## More BSH visual issues. Going to try and get to the bottom of it.
- a bad indent in stylus was applying global styles to `<li>`. Indented and it fixed everything.

## Realized my "claims" need some outside padding

## HLF: Also realized I already have a style guide. Need to add new claims to it.

## RSC Meeting for VNT
- embed a wufoo form won't affect style
- ask about domain whitelisting
- mentioned zapier 

## HLF Rebuild angular apps
- failing currently
- waiting on eli to push up his package.json updates

## FMB Blog Meeting
- needs to go in between paragraphs
- best thing would be to just sideload the image somehow and add an image tag wrapped in a div to the text area directly in stag1. 
- add this to the image `style="width:100%;height: auto;"`

## HLF added claims to the styleguide
