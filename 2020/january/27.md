## PGP Umbraco courier documentation

## PGP Merge to staging
- went smoothly

## PGP Missed analytics
- checking store locator
- staging builds
- moving all gtm-mig pages to staging via courier

## Bitbucket permission issues
- added H to admin

## TYS Filtering meeting

## PGP Remove conversion.js
- another removal request I cannot find
- ah, it was in master.master. 
- With E we figured out that old pages w/o a template still use the .master pages. These will break if you try and re-publish them because they only work because they're cached.

## JMS recipes peer review

## Accessibility task force stuff
- finishing videos
- working on website checklist a bit
  - found a good plugin to make the vuex store save to localstorage
