## Releasing TAP
- C giving me more access to Jira to manage releases

## Accessibility training doc

## Looking at PGP "blurry images" issue.
- figured out it was the slider not accommodating more extreme aspect ratios
- staging issue is an issue with the SSL
  
## Accessibility and website checklist

## Lupe, learning how to sync v-model and vuex
- working on this, I'm understanding what T was trying to do better. He had a group of vuex files for different parts of the new object, and he used the word Master to refer to the main object, while it might have sub-recipes. I need to work on this idea with a little more detail and sketch some stuff out on paper.

## PSI UX regroup before client meeting tomorrow
