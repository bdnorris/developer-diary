## Looking into TYS Curator.io issues. 
- Confused, need to research more

## Lupe regroup
- Discussed that authentication needs to be the priority
- Discussed moving away from Nuxt, no real reason

## PGP Small tasks, table toggle
- I did discover that the old jQuery slideToggle doesn't work on tables, you need to wrap it in a div and toggle that.

## PGP Small tasks, turn Ps into a list

## Reviewing PGP Total Foodservice Landing Page
- starting work, mostly custom HTML modules that T started.

## JMS Recipe kick-off

## Back to PGP Total Foodservice
- since we're relying on mostly "Custom HTML" modules rather than existing components, there are some limitations:
  - cannot do a full width background, all Umbraco modules are placed in a container with a max width.
- done for now, need to browser test and test links. 
- also need to figure out how this popup works.
