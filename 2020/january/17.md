## PGP Analytics
- giving up on etailer exit for now. Maybe i'll learn something later that will help
- more fun stuff, there is content in Umbraco that matches what's on the page, but it's not actually active. Have to look around real close.
- There's also a kind of module that just references a razor file.
- ! need to make tasks to push up Umbraco content. Tagging in notion.
- Complete on phase 1 and 2

## JMS "Pixel" issue.

## PGP "Blurry" Images
- Thumbnails from PGIS are too small
- upped them, but can't test
