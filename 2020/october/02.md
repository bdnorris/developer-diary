## CRB Baker's Fix
- wrote comprehensive instructions for how to create this stuff in Wordpress

## DFA Pardot Landing Page
- using my site builder with inline stylesheets
- need XD
- 25MB is too big for a GIF
- found that forms in landing pages are done like

```html
<section pardot-region="contact-form" class=%%content%%>
   
</section>
```

## SHF Pro
- fix "or"
- check home page meta description
- working on sales rep thank you page
- rufina open type features
  - the below worked

`font-feature-settings: 'dlig', 'liga', 'calt';`
actually, just need 'liga'.   dlig is discretionary, calt is contextual alternates

- superscripting on resource titles
