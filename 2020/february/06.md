## Accessibility Task Force
- Looking at some more component stuff. 
- Trying Pa11y
  - Got Pa11y CI working in my nuxt base when there is a sitemap to work against. Used `wait-on` package as suggested here.

- Updated dependencies while I was at it. 

## Fix version for TAP release

## Getting Mission Going
- A lot of version issues and web.config issues that E fixed
- Replaced gulp build completely and changed some folder structures
- H1 stuff was fairly straightforward after that
