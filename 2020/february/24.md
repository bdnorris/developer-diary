## JMS EE Date change on JMS Staging

## MSN ADA Recipe icons

## Checking on TMZ WP login for BD
- seems fine

## MSN ADA More icons, 
- found a few that seem to be deprecated on the site
- most of these are decorative, hope it wasn't a waste of time.
- so many fake links, fake `<a>` tags. Maybe I can fix if I have time.

## Quick chat with K about color contrast on image backgrounds for ADA
- seems like AXE actually can't score those, it's a manual thing, not sure about Dynomapper

## SBXCA French translation issues
did one part, but too many things I don't understand in the task

## MSN ADA, skip to content link
- no issues.
- missed lots of 'outline: none's because they were set to outline: 0 instead
- scroll-margin-top works well! https://caniuse.com/#search=scroll-margin-top

## TMZ WP work
- make repo
- make child theme

## MSN ADA, product menu keyboard accessibility
