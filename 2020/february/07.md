## A bit of MSN rework to review

## First though, going through Accessibility dev training doc
- modal codepen

## MSN H1, missing header issue
- Umbraco fix

## BSH update attempt
- not going so well
- meteor patch runs but won't deploy
  - failing

## SMK UI Kit
- just ran 'npm audit fix' on fabricator and everything worked fine I think
- need to remember that `yarn audit` is a thing.
