## Trying TMZ FTP
- works, can install plugins this way
- but someone has uploaded a ton of huge JPGs, so WP Migration tool can't finish
- duplicator could filter them, but it can't finish because of some other issue.

## Working on MN BA "Cinemgraph"
- handbrake compressed well, new fields in Umbraco work fine
- found this about iOS if you want a mp4 with autoplay on mute to work, 
  - make sure there's no audio track at all
  - include 'playsinline' attribute

## Helping B with more WP stuff. Flamingo works.
