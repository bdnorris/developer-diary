## Handing off TMZ to M

## MSN Accessibility
- finishing product navigation keyboard Accessibility
- focus-within does not work in old Edge, just the new chromium version
  - acceptable
- no IE support at all

## JMS Spinner regroup
- I suggested we move to a vertical scroller instead of a wheel because it's more practical, that seems to be the direction we'll go

## MSN Accessibility
- FAQ and Accordion keyboard work
- had to hide checkboxes w/o display none so they were focusable. 
- even with outline: none killed, still a lot of highlight issues!
- replaced some, but not all of the fake links

## BSH, gonna check progress and look over the files
- good, except need to get a webfont procured

## MNR, starting cookie notification
