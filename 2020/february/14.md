## SBXCA Forms
- Already tagged, nothing to do
- but, having some issues with the form in production

## Re-looking at my JMS EE Timing cookie logic
I don't remember this, but looks useful
```
  function docReady(fn) {
    // see if DOM is already available
    if (
      document.readyState === 'complete' ||
      document.readyState === 'interactive'
    ) {
      // call on next available tick
      setTimeout(fn, 1);
    } else {
      document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', fn);
    }
  }
```

Very confused when working in Milliseconds. Just pushed through it and got it working.
