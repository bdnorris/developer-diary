## Company meeting

## Dev share out presentation work

## Website checklist over lunch
- additions
  - Duplicate content and canonical urls
  - strict transport header, and others, get from E
  - Forms, if not behind sign-in, need recaptcha

## Looking at become a customer form on SBX CA
- found that NSTL messed up the domain, no www doesn't work. (SSL Issue)
- can't find the reCaptcha account
- the zip code thing seems fine though, R made it so it won't allow anything other than a valid Canadian zip code, but it does pre-populate the value with underscores, which is maybe what's throwing them off. 

## SBX CA Tagging Form submissions
- added a form tag to GTM (staging)
- need creds, and recaptcha to be fixed

## SBX CA Privacy Policy stuff

## More dev shareout work
