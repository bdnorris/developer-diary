## Check on CRB Flywheel connection
findings...

Good news is, they already have a staging site...

Flywheel also has a tool called “Local” to run stuff locally. I’ve installed this and gotten connected. However, I cannot push to staging from Local w/o paying for “Local Pro” $20/month. Worth it in my opinion.

I also cannot login to the Wordpress admin with the credentials you supplied. Likely this is a separate account that’s needed in the Wordpress admin itself.
