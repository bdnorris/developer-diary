## PGP French symbol problems
- problems go back to 2016. Weird characters in place of accented e. 
- `é`
- `e&#769;` <- entity
- `�`

Fixing display with html entity works fine, but can't figure out why the urls keep getting turned into...
`/solutions/d%C3%83%C2%A9sinfection/`

Manual URL encoding works. 
é = '%C3%A9'
è = '%C3%A8'

Also found out that if you rename a node in Umbraco, then name it back, Umbraco automatically makes a redirect. So you could rename it something without accents, put them back, then it should work. 

## KNR Swap Tool 
Technical requirements from MM;
- one zipped package with all tool contents
- should be able to run directly from an index.html in local browser
- standalone app with all needed js/css/img resources relative to base folder
- example structure in folder:
--> index.html
--> img/image.png
--> css/main.css
--> js/main.js

A Vue app seems to meet this criteria, but I worry that the assets will have trouble. I'll need to know that route before building.

https://cli.vuejs.org/config/#publicpath

"This value is also respected during development. If you want your dev server to be served at root instead, you can use a conditional value:"

```js
module.exports = {
  publicPath: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
    ? '/production-sub-path/'
    : '/'
}
```
