## MSN Check on styleguide, looks good

## BSH Global work, continue on slider

## TMZ Still trying to make something work
- styles kill the sidebars on mobile
- still, changes don't affect anything
- Figured out they are using Securi on a DNS level, maybe if we had access to that count
- It was trying to load my customizations.css file, but there was MIME-Type problem
- best solutions is just to put the form in the body, but can't style it. 

```html
<style>
#wpcf7-f9513-p9671-o1 input.wpcf7-form-control {
      max-width: 100%!important;
margin: 0 auto;
}
#wpcf7-f9513-p9671-o1 select.wpcf7-form-control.wpcf7-select,
#wpcf7-f9513-p9671-o1 input.wpcf7-form-control.wpcf7-submit {
      width: 100%!important;
}
.sidebar-split-bottom {
   display: none;
}
.wpcf7-form p {
text-align:center;
color: #777;
}
</style>
```

## BSH, start things other than the carousel
