## MSN Accessibility Checkin
- need to peer review K's style guide before it goes to the client

## FMB Issues with staging
- turns out, the last release was never patched, so my diff was missing older stuff, redid.

## BSH Carousel
- figured out how to use blaze templating better.
- https://guide.meteor.com/v1.3/blaze.html
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31817073/meteor-passing-array-parameter-to-template
  - check the comments on that last one, the code sample is not correct
