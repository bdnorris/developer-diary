## MSN Accessibility focus states. 
- this is kinda working for something sorta like what the designer wants...

```scss
a:active, a:focus { 
	outline: 2px solid currentColor;
	box-shadow: 0 0 3px 2px currentColor;
}
```

Then for buttons, you have to use the background color instead of `currentColor`

## MSN Accessibility keyboard stuff

## MSN Live text instead of images
had to add a checkbox to the custom data type that feeds the "archetype" system. These models seem to exist in the database. Might have to add a text field additionally or instead.
