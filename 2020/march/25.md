## MSN Accessibility Check-in
- testing troubles
  
## BSH Swaps
- working well, basically using the slide object to make the slides, then matching that to an object in another file by a keyword, then laying out the template

## Consulting on FLG cancellation

## BSH Arrow and auto-play issues
- passing as a prop, but still honoring prefers reduced motion

```js
  var autoplay = this.data.autoplay
  var accessibleAutoPlay = function () {
    if (autoplay) {
      // autoplay is true, so lets check if the user prefers reduced motion
      prm = window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)');
      return !prm.matches // return false if the user DOES prefer reduced motion
    } else {
      return autoplay
    }
  }
```
