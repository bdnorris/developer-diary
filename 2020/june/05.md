## No Internet all morning. 

## Restaurant Help Site analytics problem (Email from G)

## VNTR Covid page
setting up WP Engine stuff
don't have the real XD file

## PGP PriceSpider stuff
- found a selector that works to only get things in the active widget
- there might be something related to the fact that nodeLists are hard to reset, could have been a red herring though
- was able to check PriceSpider.UTID earlier this week, but maybe they've changed something already, switched to PriceSpider.userId
- pushed up something thats working though

## VNTR Covid page
- added custom fields, but still need XD file and the video file

## JMS AOFB
- adjusting use cases

## JMS OCS starting rework
