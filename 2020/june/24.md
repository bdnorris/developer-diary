## BSH Keep trying on Meteor Candy
- can't seem to get anything from the DB
  - going to try some other apps
- maybes
  - https://www.internal.io/
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongo-express
  - https://retool.com/integrations/

Going to try mongo-express
- cannot figure out how the ids in the db connect to anything in Amazon S3
- I am maybe to ignorant to get mongo-express running

retool
- pretty cool, but a lot of setup needed to make the "apps"

going to see how bad it will actually be to add a product manually, for instance
