  - Pardot is having an issue with a field being required
  - zip field was misnamed
  - possible issue with the opt in checkbox on the sample form, setting to rework

## JMS OCS
- forms!!!!
  - Pardot is saying something is required and not set on the sample form. Cannot figure out. 
  - note to self, checkboxes that aren't checked don't automatically get set. 
  - It was because 'tel' was set to a number in Pardot, but of course, telephone numbers have punctuation. set to text instead.
