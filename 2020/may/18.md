  - I was doing the same thing, apparently there's no need for :checked because v-model handles it
  - SVG sizes aren't coming across. 
    - Need to wrap them all in a div probably
    - fixed with wrapper and other things
  - Video event issue
  - nope, I had change form events and click events that were both firing. Don't need the change if I have the click, v-model takes care of the rest.
