## All Spreads Estimate
- don't quite understand it

## AOFB Jira

## SEM RFP Meeting

## MRZ HTTPS Issue / Form E-mail issues

## JMS OCS Copy change

## BSH Redirection
- serverside not working, ended up just window.location-ing it

## AOFB Smuckers

## BSH - deploy Redirection
- my image code went live too, and it wasn't right, I guess in blaze, if you expect another parameter, it seems to push through some default one, but unclear what. Checking for it not being an object worked.
- Redeployed.
