## SBX TVN Logo Updates
- done, but need to QA

## Review FIQ Site ahead of meeting

## SBX TVN QA

- Slide 4/15, I could probably edit that graphic if designers are too busy. 
- On the training module, there were a lot of instances of "Teavana" with no TMs at all. I added Â® to all, let me know if I should remove from some.

## JMS OCS PDF and Copy Updates
- 9MB is still to big, having E check on size
- copy update done
  
## TMZ BB Carousel
- slider is only configured to link internally
  - added a page to link to
  - made a redirect of that exact url to the external url
  - attached slider to that page
  - works!
