## SHF Corp Timeline
- tweak
- send to SV
- add "real" video

## BSH Missing PDFs
- received some PDFs
- some are not split up and not named to match the originals
- otherwise, I added the correct id prefixes and uploaded to Amazon

## SHF Corp Timeline
- finished writing sub-animations
- start and end are killing me
  - After debugging, i'm getting inconsistent results because gsap is recomputing things, but that include positions of items
  - SO: I either need to:
    - use values that when computed tell me the thing is in the viewport
    - or set variables on load and resize, rather than returning from functions that keep getting computed
