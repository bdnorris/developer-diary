Once pyftsubset is working, then glyphhanger will use it, and you can get the subset by providing the url to your site and it'll use what's actually on the page. 

`glyphhanger https://smuckerawayfromhome.com --family="Raleway" --formats=woff2,woff --subset=*.ttf`

### WORKS!!! 
### But!

Going to have use fontsquirrel instead to make subsetted version of the non-variable font.## Design to Dev Guide
