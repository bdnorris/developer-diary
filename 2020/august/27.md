## SHF WPEngine setup
after not having a lot of success mixing git pushes and the Local app, looking at using WPMigrateDB Pro as an option with Docker. Additionally I'm realizing that Gravity forms being stored in production is going to mess with all the good stuff regarding database pushes and staging being the source of truth. 

- starting again with git/docker local workflow
- well, wpconfig mismatches between wpengine and docker are also problematic
  - could just deal with this by gitignoring and making a custom one?
  - duh, just delete all that, docker doesn't need it, and git pushes don't need it
