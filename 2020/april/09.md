## CRB Baker's
- moving to tablet and desktop styles
- realizing both flexbox and grid for two-columns of accordions doesn't really work. Best way would be to just divide the amount of things by two, round up, then make a new column. 
  - could not figure out a JS way, which is maybe dumb anyway, but noting it here. Tried appending HTML, but when I try to append `</ul><ul>` to close then open a new list, the browser always corrects it and assumes what I actually meant was `<ul></ul>`.
  - Just did this in PHP instead, works fine. It does make two lists for what is essentially just one, but I don't think that's a gigantic deal. 

## BSH MongoDB migration
- starting with just some investigation to how these are set, how I could back them up, etc. 
- password doesn't work. ... ok.

## CRB Baker's
- testing analytics events
- actually, I think they do have GTM. Will need access to setup a generic event.
- Inputting Bread content
  - some weird things in the doc, noted to account service
- I forgot desktop type sizes
