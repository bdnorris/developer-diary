## CRB Baker's Take
- go back through content, pull db to local

## BSH Salesforce
- try Zapier for real
- works really well
- _paths_ feature is only available for *Pro* accounts
  - so, updating a lead isn't really do-able, but I am checking for existence using email as the key
  - have several questions out to A
  - can probably start on the code though

## Reviewing K's XD Files for JMS OCS work
- advised to tighten crops on the cups
- sent back, I could get started

## BSH Salesforce
