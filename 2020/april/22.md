- Q4
  - realized that sometimes instead of using the <image> element, XD will do a "pattern" thing, messing up my mix-blend selector
  - need to update all of the accessible texts
- Q5, has checkboxes instead, will need to come back and revisit
- Q6
- here's my quick and dirty image preloading, if all of the paths were in an array

```js
var image = []
this.imagesToPreload.map((img, i) => {
  image[i] = new Image()
  image[i].src = img
})
```
