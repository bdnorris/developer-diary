## JMS OCS SVG work
- working on a way to use vue-svg-loader and named things in a way I can automate the animations

## PLV Responding to B's Email regarding the contract and code handoff

## BSH Zapier work
- realizing getting data from Salesforce back isn't really a thing unless I write my own hook on my own server to consume a webhook from Zapier. 
  - the alternative would be to get more integrated with Salesforce directly. Here's where I left off on that for later: https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_quickstart_steps.htm   ---
- I notified AS that the future project for a "preference center" may be more complex than I first thought.
- For now, I'll have two Zaps, and I'll just fire off both. One will try to create a new record, the other will update an existing. I think this is ok, because one will always fail and one will always succeed. The worst thing would be a record is created, then immediately updated with the same information. Maybe I should set the create one to delay for 30 seconds or so.
