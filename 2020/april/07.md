## BSH SSL Emergency

## MSN Estimation Questions

## BSH Salesforce
- Trying Zapier
- recommending Zapier, making 'apps' in salesforce is confusing and tedious

## Finish getting setup on CRB

## PGP Tagging, I made a mistake and left a class off :(

## MSN Errors Estimation
- turned into JMS OCS Timing discussion

## Really getting going with CRB
