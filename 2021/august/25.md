## Put in time

## MRLNCO
- can't duplicate issue

## Team Meeting

## MN Push changes live and send DNS request

## JMS OCS
- update with new asset

## JMS Footer
- figure out what M did
- probably just hardcode it

## DS / GM
- more analytics
- main GA4 difference seems to be that you only have one required field, need to find out if "NAME" replaces "Category" in how we've normally been using it. 

## JMS OCS
- remove debugging

## JMS Footer rework, again
- trying to simplify the footer

## SHF Copy
- new form copied from old form
