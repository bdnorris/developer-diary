## Rollbar testing

## TMZ K12 Listing
- realized querying a bunch of ACF checkboxes is trickier than I thought since it returns an array of checked values
```php
$args = array(
	'post_type'		=> 'food_products',
	'post_status' => 'publish',
	'posts_per_page' => 9, 
	'orderby' => 'title', 
	'order' => 'ASC', 
	'paged' => $paged,
	'meta_query'	=> array(
		'relationship' => 'AND',
		array(
			'key' => 'other',
			'value' => serialize( strval( 2 ) ),
			'compare' => 'LIKE'
		),
		array(
			'key'	 	=> 'product_category',
			'value'	  	=> $category_value, // product category value, see above
			'compare' 	=> 'IN',
		),
	),
);
```

So... serializing the value allows a LIKE comparison. Works okay, ... I'm pretty sure.

## SEM Client Requested Code
- had a video meeting
- probably the reason the code was crashing was because that page wasn't using the standard header where that header code was
- Plan on putting thier code in a div above the footer and the third party will style it? 
	- I dunno, but it'll be on them eventually. 
	- for now, it'll just be collecting data and not showing anything.
