## BSH Recipe Fixes

## Start CRB Marketo

## Team Meeting

## CSSI Meeting
- materials coming to do an estimate on next week

## CRB Marketo
- some progress, noting that mjml nesting messes up the intros

## MRZ Forms

## Check MRZ Portal again
- found ACF fields are generated via code
	- everything looks fine
- logged into FTP, but the wp-content folder is empty

## CRB Marketo
- found a [custom component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mjml-marketo) that might work, but now I have to learn how to use it.
