## MRZ Portal
- more discussion about how my FTP for their site doesn't give me any access

## CRB Bakers Fix
- menu got messed up, fixed by reassigning the WP menu to the WP menu location

## MRZ Wing Sauce
- form toggle bug
	- I messed up the selector, not sure why it ever worked :faceslap
	- looks like [jquery slidetoggle works better with fixed widths](https://www.bennadel.com/blog/2263-use-jquerys-slidedown-with-fixed-width-elements-to-prevent-jumping.htm), bummer but not a big deal for this

## CRB Site Audit Meeting

## CRB Marketo Templates
- giving up on MJML :(
- looking around, but probably just going to continue with a nunjucks but manual build

## Reviews
