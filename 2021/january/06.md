## SBXCA Accessibility
- looking closer at Modals
- only other issue on public pages is the forgot password modal. This is just a bad pattern as its a modal launched from an existing modal, so there's no way to return focus back to the original modal w/o forcing the original one to open again. It does return focus to the original initiator, so maybe it's ok. 
- I'm going to make a list of signed-in modals to keep in case we need it later. 

## JMS JF Campaign Pages
- Getting set up

## BSH Student page
- modal issues with 700px or less height in the viewport
- some wacky math, but I'm happy with it.

```scss
.modal {
  position: relative;
  top: unquote("min(calc(50vh - 23vw), calc(50vh - (23vh/0.5625)))");
  padding: 1.75em;
  background-color: white;
  max-width: unquote("min(92vw, 92vh/0.5625)");
  margin: auto auto;
}
```

"Unquote" is to deal with the fact Sass also has min() and max() functions built in that conflict with CSSs. 

... nevermind, not quite working. 

Didn't actually need that top, centered with flexbox...

```scss
.modal-wrapper {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  background-color: rgba($llgray, 0.8);
  z-index: map-get($z, top);
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
.modal {
  position: relative;
  padding: 1.75em;
  background-color: white;
  width: unquote("min(92vw, 92vh/0.5625)");
  margin: auto auto;
}
```
