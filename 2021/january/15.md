## Cleaning up Jira

## JMS JF Campaign small fix

## SHF Accessibility
- home page paragraphs
- getting local enviro back up to date
- dealing with background videos
	- added support to honor prefers-reduced-motion
	- adding pause buttons, giving up on. Layout is just too complex for me to put a button in a good place. This is mostly because the background videos have overlays on top of them. 
- running Microsoft accessibility insights on a few pages
	- home page, fixed any issues
		- including moving some acf fed style stuff to the head
	- about page
		- no way I can clear the animating timeline
			- it's keyboard accessible, but it doesn't animate on keyboard focus. I don't think this is possible. 
			- text reflow: all text fields have limitations on heights, so reflow or text resize can only go so far. 
	- contact page
		- can't change gravity forms input types after the fact, so we're stuck with not having the correct tel or email types. Works ok in practice though.
