## BSH Forms
- checking if changing notification settings lowers the price of formkeep
	- yep, making notifications be daily summaries instead of after every submission allows a lower tier plan

## SBX Accessibility
- On the Go Yellow Color
- Modals :/
	- current modals use foundation/reveal. The newest version is accessible, but it doesn't seem like an easy replacement, and it doesn't really make sense to use all of Foundation just for that. 
	- found a replacement, but it would be a very big job to replace all modals on the site all at once. 
	- going to start by just replacing the sign-in modal and see how that goes
- Registration process checks (form labels and headings mostly)
	- add to 
- Modals 
	- a lot of our modals are actually programmatically initialized to do things on the 'opened' event, so we can return focus to the initiator on the 'closed' events in these cases. 
	- close buttons aren't tab-able because they are fake links. Changing them to buttons works. 
	- login done.
	- register done.


## SBX Winter
- get assets?
